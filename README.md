Swift Courier is an Android app that allows users to track and manage delivery orders. The app enables users to fetch order details by entering an Order ID, update the status of deliveries (e.g., mark as "Delivered"), and view the full delivery information including the address. Additionally, users can open the delivery address in Google Maps for navigation. The app uses `SharedPreferences` to save and retrieve order data. It features a simple and user-friendly interface, with buttons for fetching orders, updating statuses, and viewing detailed delivery information.
